        <h2>Alpha</h2>
        <p>
            Alpha Particle, positively charged nuclear particle, symbol α, consisting of two protons bound to two neutrons. Alpha particles are emitted spontaneously in some types of radioactive decay (see Radioactivity). They are also produced when helium-4 atoms are completely ionized (see Ion; see Ionization). Alpha particles are also notated ¸He«+.

        <h2>Beta</h2>
        <p>
            Beta Particle, electrically charged particle emitted by certain radioactive elements, such as uranium and berkelium. Beta particles are produced when the nucleus of an unstable atom spontaneously decays, or transforms, changing the atom into an atom of a more stable element. In this process, the nucleus emits a beta particle and another elementary particle called a neutrino. Two types of beta decay occur. One type releases a positively charged beta particle called a positron; the other type releases a negatively charged beta particle called a negatron. The negatron is identical to the electron found in atoms.

            The terms beta particle and beta radiation are used interchangeably. The term beta ray originally referred to a stream of beta particles, but it is no longer used. See also Radioactivity.

        <h2>Gama</h2>
        <p>
            Vasco da Gama (1469?-1524), Portuguese explorer and navigator, who was the first person to reach India from Europe by a sea route. Da Gama was born in Sines, in southwestern Portugal. He joined the Portuguese navy at a young age and participated in the wars against the Spanish kingdom of Castile. Little else is known of his early life.

        <h2>Delta</h2>
        <p>
            Delta (rocket), family of rockets that began service as satellite-launching vehicles for the United States government in 1960. By the year 2000, Delta rockets had successfully launched more than 250 missions. These missions included the launch of Telstar 1, the first telephone and television communications satellite, in 1962, and the launch of 24 Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites for navigation, beginning in 1989.
